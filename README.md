- 👋 Hi, I’m @kilianrd
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, of course, but I'm also a big fan of hanging out, doing any kind of sport and mostly having great experiences!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Frontend technologies as main, but I like to step on to many different languages and projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything as long as I learn something about it.
- 📫 How to reach me: 📧kilianrd01@gmail.com
